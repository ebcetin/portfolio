1. Hydrogen Bonds -- Implications? (2022)

What could be the governing indicator for the highly evolving DHFR? We looked into hydrogen bonds, calculated time-dependent autocorrelation functions, studied the side-chain behavior. 

2. Free Energy -- DHFR

What is free energy, and how can we measure it?
- reaction coordinate
- windows of rcs
- equilibrium dynamics
     reactants, products, sub-ns wells,
     pre-catalytic stage
- non-equilibrium dynamics
     pre-catalytic stage
     catalytic stage
-Zwanzig -- Non-eqiulibrium dynamics -- Hot gas dynamics -- Free Energy Perturbation Method
-alchemlyb

What is the maximum amount of work we can extract from DHFR -- DHF -- Trimethoprim system?
3. Free Energy -- High Throughput

How can we apply everything we learned in a high-throughput system?

4. Chemical Barriers -- Reaction Coordinates

A practical study to understand a working inhibitor's mechanism  (DHFR - TMP - D4TMP (TMP derivative))
